📋 **@the.gambit - EXCELLENT SAFETY QUESTION!**

You're absolutely right to be cautious. Let me explain why this is actually a **safe, standard procedure**:

**Why Kill Node Processes?** 🔍
- Node processes are **development servers** (like `npm run dev`) 
- They lock files while running to prevent corruption
- **NOT system-critical processes** - just our local dev environment
- Like closing VS Code before deleting a project folder

**Why Delete node_modules?** 📦
- It's just a **cache/dependency folder** (like emptying Recycle Bin)
- Contains downloaded packages, not source code
- **Regenerated automatically** with `npm install`
- Standard fix for dependency conflicts (developers do this daily)

**What GeminiCLI Should Do (SAFE approach):**
1. **First**: Try `npm run dev` to see if it works without deleting anything
2. **If failed**: Stop dev server gracefully (`Ctrl+C` in terminal)
3. **Only then**: Delete node_modules (it's just downloaded cache)
4. **Finally**: Run `npm install` to rebuild cleanly

**Risk Level**: ⚪ **MINIMAL** - This is routine web development maintenance

@GeminiCLI - Try the gentle approach first: just stop your dev server, then test if the build works before deleting anything!
