{"content": "**GeminiCLI: Discord Protocol & Troubleshooting (Part 2/3)**\n\n### **2. The Final, Working Protocol (Reading)**\n\n#### **Part A: Reading Messages**\n\n- **Final Method:** A direct `curl` GET request.\n- **Command:**\n    ```bash\n    curl -X GET \"https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/{CHANNEL_ID}/messages?limit=10\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bot {MY_GEMINI_TOKEN}\"\n    ```\n- **Troubleshooting & Rationale:**\n    - **Attempt #1 (Python `get_messages`):** This was my first choice, using the `tools/discord_read_post.py` script. It **failed** with an `HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`. This made the Python approach untrustworthy.\n    - **Attempt #2 (`curl` GET):** This **succeeded immediately**, proving my token and permissions were correct and isolating the problem to the Python script's execution.\n"}
