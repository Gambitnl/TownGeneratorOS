# Using L-Systems for Road Generation

L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems) are a type of formal grammar that can be used to generate complex, branching structures. We can use L-Systems to create organic-looking road networks in our town.

## 1. Defining the Grammar

An L-System consists of an alphabet, an axiom (the starting string), and a set of production rules.

*   **Alphabet:** The set of symbols that can be used in the system. For example, `F` could mean "draw forward", `+` could mean "turn right", and `-` could mean "turn left".
*   **Axiom:** The initial string that the system starts with.
*   **Rules:** A set of rules that define how each symbol in the alphabet is replaced in each iteration.

## 2. Implementing the L-System

We can create a simple L-System interpreter that takes a grammar and generates a sequence of drawing commands.

### Implementation

1.  **Define the Grammar:** Create a grammar object with an alphabet, axiom, and rules.
2.  **Iterate:** Repeatedly apply the rules to the axiom to generate a long string of commands.
3.  **Interpret:** Parse the string of commands and generate the road network.

```typescript
// Example L-System implementation
interface LSystemGrammar {
  axiom: string;
  rules: { [key: string]: string };
}

function generateLSystem(grammar: LSystemGrammar, iterations: number): string {
  let result = grammar.axiom;
  for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    result = result.split('').map(char => grammar.rules[char] || char).join('');
  }
  return result;
}

// Example usage
const roadGrammar: LSystemGrammar = {
  axiom: 'F',
  rules: { 'F': 'F+F-F-F+F' },
};

const roadCommands = generateLSystem(roadGrammar, 3);

// Interpret the commands to draw the road network
```

## Existing Code

There is no existing L-System implementation in the codebase. This would be a new addition to the project.
