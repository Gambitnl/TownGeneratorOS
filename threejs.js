The template text can include substitution variables that will be replaced when displaying the template for a specific person.

- User defined variable (e.g. $option1): A value will assigned to the person from the options for the variable defined below, and will render here.
- $aOrAn: Displays "a" or "an", depending on what the next letter is. E.g. "$aOrAn armadillo" will render as "an armadillo", while "$aOrAn builder" will render as "a builder".
- $haveOrHas: Displays "have" or "has", depending on a persons pronouns. E.g. "They have", "she has".
- $height: Displays the height of the person in cm, followed by ft - e.g. "$height" could be rendered as "173cm (5'8")
- $pronoun: Displays the subject pronoun for person's gender, (e.g. he/she/they)
- $capitalisedPronoun: Same as above, but capitalised. (e.g. He/She/They)

The conditions control if the line will be shown or hidden - this can be used to display different things based on the gender of the person, their age, or based on a specific trait.

When displaying the template, first the conditions are evaluated, and then the variables are substituted. The result of this is joined into one long line.

In the settlement file, only a few key details are saved per person. The rest is generated when the person is selected. When a person in manually edited, those generated details are locked in, alongside any manual edits. These generated details depend on the race, for example a persons name and appearance.

Editing a race doesn't directly change any people in the file. Only people who lazy load details will change, as they will generate based on the new race. If some of their details are persisted, only the ones that aren't will appear to update.

To illustrate, here are some examples:
- Ages are always persisted, so updating the age config for a race will not update anyone.
- Given a race appearance template that has hair colour option values ['blonde', 'brown']. If a person is manually edited to have 'brown' hair, internally this is represented as '1' (the second value in the list). If the race is then edited, with the 'brown' value changing to 'red', then that manually edited person now has red hair. If that option is removed, then the person will now have '' (blank) hair.

As you can see, this is a complicated system. This is a list of things that are considered 'safe' and will keep the existing people consistent with the new race definition.
- Changing the race name
- Adding name generators
- Adding + removing + editing template lines
- Adding template option values
