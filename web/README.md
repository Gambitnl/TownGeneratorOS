# Medieval Fantasy City Generator (Web Port)

This directory contains the web-based port of the original Medieval Fantasy City Generator.

**Purpose:** This project is an ongoing effort to port the core city generation logic from its original Haxe / OpenFL / msignal codebase to a modern web stack using TypeScript, React, and CSS, with Node.js for potential backend services.

The goal is to eventually replace the reliance on the Haxe-compiled JavaScript output with native TypeScript implementations, allowing for easier development, maintenance, and integration with modern web technologies.
