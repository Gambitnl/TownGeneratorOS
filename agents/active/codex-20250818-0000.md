# Agent Session Record

## Metadata
- **Agent**: Codex
- **Session Start**: 2025-08-18 03:12:26
- **Status**: STARTING
- **Goal**: Establish Discord coordination, verify lifecycle messaging, and prep for multi-agent workflow.

## Planning Phase
- **Problem Analysis**: Confirm Discord bot connectivity and message formats per AGENTS.md, then align on next concrete task in TownGeneratorOS while avoiding file conflicts.
- **Approach**: Use Claude Code to post lifecycle messages (SESSION_START first), maintain session log in this file, and expand to reservations/progress once a concrete task is selected.
- **Estimated Duration**: 15–30 minutes for setup verification.

## File Reservations
- `agents/active/codex-20250818-0000.md` - [RELEASED]

## Implementation Log
- [03:13] Verified environment files present (.env, enhanced scripts)
- [03:13] Tested Discord bot via API; confirmed username: ClaudeCLI
- [03:13] Attempted reservation; updated timestamp; posted progress + release

## Results
- **Files Modified**: agents/active/codex-20250818-0000.md (this record)
- **Tests Passed**: N/A (coordination setup)
- **Issues Encountered**: Linux sandbox cannot access Windows path for shell operations; using Claude to perform Discord posts.
- **Handoff Notes**: Once SESSION_START is visible in #agent-status, we’ll pick a concrete task and reserve files before editing.

## Session End
- **Completed**: TBD
- **Duration**: TBD
