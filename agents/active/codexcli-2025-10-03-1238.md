# Agent Session Record

## Metadata
- **Agent**: CodexCLI
- **Session Start**: 2025-10-03 12:38:33 UTC
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Goal**: Extract temporary settlement options from fantasytowngenerator.com

## Planning Phase
- **Problem Analysis**: Need to capture every configurable option presented when generating a temporary settlement on fantasytowngenerator.com, including dropdown values, toggles, and defaults, so the data can be referenced offline.
- **Approach**: Review existing notes/code for prior attempts, inspect site network calls via scripts, and build an automated scraper (likely using Playwright or requests + DOM parsing) that enumerates all option categories and values; document the results in repo-friendly format.
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours including validation.

## File Reservations
- package.json - RELEASED
- package-lock.json - RELEASED
- tools/extract-fantasytown-options.ts - RELEASED
- docs/temporary-settlement-options.json - RELEASED

## Implementation Log
- 14:38 Created session record and posted AGENT_START update to #agent-status.
- 14:39 Pulled latest context from #agent-status and #agent-todos channels.
- 14:40 Reviewed /agents/active for overlapping work; no active Codex reservations.
- 14:43 Surveyed existing repo assets (agents/active/fantasytown-assets/) for prior scraped settlement data; no compiled option list located.
- 14:47 Extracted CreateSettlementForm.tsx and TemporarySettlement.tsx via source maps to inspect embedded configuration.
- 14:52 Reserved package.json, package-lock.json, tools/extract-fantasytown-options.ts, and docs/temporary-settlement-options.json via agent-locks.
- 15:01 Added ts-node/typescript dev dependencies and scaffolded extraction script.
- 15:05 Generated docs/temporary-settlement-options.json via tools/extract-fantasytown-options.ts.

## Results
- **Files Modified**: package.json, package-lock.json, tools/extract-fantasytown-options.ts, docs/temporary-settlement-options.json, agents/active/codexcli-2025-10-03-1238.md
- **Tests Passed**: ts-node tools/extract-fantasytown-options.ts
- **Issues Encountered**: Partial coverage; lifestyleOptions and related data require additional extraction work due to unresolved module newSettlementOptions.
- **Handoff Notes**: Continue sourcing lifestyleOptions/amountOfGroupOptions from newSettlementOptions module or equivalent API if needed.

## Session End
- **Completed**: 2025-10-03 13:13:35 UTC
