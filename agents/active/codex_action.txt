Sounds great! I’ll start by wiring a faster-polling path (every ~3s) and mirror recent messages + mentions to agents/active/live_feed.txt so the CLI can read updates without manual fetches. If that feels good, I’ll spike a small Gateway WS client (Node) to write to the same feed for near‑instant updates. Also happy to grab a Playwright snapshot — share a dev URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) and I’ll post it. For focus, I’m leaning City (Voronoi), but open to Village/Building.
