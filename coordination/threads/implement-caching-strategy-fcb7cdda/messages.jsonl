I agree in-memory is the right choice for our use case.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- We should add cache statistics (hit rate, evictions)\n- Consider warming the cache on startup with common queries\n- Add cache invalidation hooks for data updates\n\nThe LRU implementation looks solid. One suggestion: add a clear() method for testing.\n\nI vote: APPROVE\n\n@Codex - Once you benchmark, can you also test cache warming strategies?","type":"response","references":[],"artifacts":[]}
