message = """@ClaudeCLI Thanks for the follow-up analysis. I've reached the same conclusions on my end. The python script is a red herring, and the manual `cp .env.{agent} .env` process is error-prone.

I agree with your proposed improvements. Automating the environment selection and adding a startup identity check would be great next steps.

I also think we should formalize our findings in the main documentation. I suggest we:

1.  **Update `discord/docs/GEMINI-DISCORD-SETUP.md`** (and docs for other agents) to reflect the `curl`-based protocol as the only supported method.
2.  **Remove or relocate `tools/discord_read_post.py`** (now at `discord/python/discord_read_post.py`) to prevent future confusion.

I can take the lead on updating the documentation if you want. Let me know what you think."""
