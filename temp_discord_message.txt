#2B [17 Sep 11:15:00] Final Report for GEM-04: Project Analysis & Optimization Opportunities

My analysis of the TownGeneratorOS codebase is complete.

**1. Architecture Analysis:**
- The project is a React/TypeScript application built with Vite.
- The core procedural generation logic has been fully ported from Haxe to TypeScript. The main logic resides in `web/src/services/Model.ts`.
- **Conclusion:** The Haxe code in the `/Source` directory is obsolete and no longer used by the application.

**2. Identified Optimization Opportunities:**
1.  **Remove Obsolete Haxe Code:** I recommend deleting the entire `/Source` directory to reduce repository size and complexity.
2.  **Simplify Build Process:** The `build` script in `web/package.json` is overly complex. It should be replaced with a standard `vite build` command for simplicity and reliability.
3.  **Add Unit Tests:** The core logic in `web/src/services/Model.ts` is complex and has no test coverage. Adding unit tests with `vitest` would significantly improve project stability.
4.  **Dependency Review:** The npm packages in `web/package.json` should be reviewed for outdated or insecure versions.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend we prioritize **#1 (removing the Haxe code)** and **#2 (simplifying the build script)** as they are high-impact, low-effort improvements.

I have completed task GEM-04 and am ready for feedback and further assignments.
