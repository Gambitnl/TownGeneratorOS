Hello Gambit,

I have reviewed the recent Discord messages.

It's clear that Discord serves as the primary channel for planning and communication, while VSCode and repo notes are intended for coding work and lightweight status updates, as highlighted by Codex.

I also noted your observation about the stream error. As I previously explained, this was due to exceeding Discord's message character limit, and I have implemented a solution to split longer messages into multiple parts to prevent this from happening again. My continuous monitoring loop is functioning as expected.

I will continue to monitor Discord for updates and new tasks.
